## Controlling Home Assistant

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK, Nabu".
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn on the light*.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure youâ€™re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).
