title: "About wake words"

Wake words are special words or phrases that tell a voice assistant that a command is about to be spoken. The device then switches from passive to active listening. Examples are: *Hey Google*, *Hey Siri*, or *Alexa*. Home Assistant supports its own wake words, such as *Hey Nabu*.

OpenWakeWord currently only works for English wake words. This is because there is still a lack of models in other languages with many different speakers. Similar models for other languages can be trained as more multi-speaker models per language become available.
