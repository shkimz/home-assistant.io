#### About the image specifications

Here's what you need to know to get the best result on your ESP32-S3-BOX-3 screen.

##### Using light and dark image background

In the [overview diagram](#esp32-s3-box-3-voice-assistant-status-illustrations), you can see that the default images use different background colors. This is to make it easier to recognize a state change when you look at your screen.

In your images, you could use 2 different background colors:

- For loading and idle: use a dark background
- For listening, thinking, and replying: use a light background
- For error: As you like

If your images have transparency, you can define the background color in the configuration. The procedure below shows how to change the background.
